Description of the AES-256 File Encryption & Decryption Tool
This Python script provides AES-256 encryption and decryption for files using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with Tkinter. It ensures secure file storage and transfer by encrypting files with a password-based key. The application allows users to select a file, enter a password, encrypt it into a secure format, and later decrypt it using the same password.

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with 256-bit key size is a highly secure encryption algorithm used in government, military, and corporate environments for data protection. This script is particularly useful for securing sensitive files such as personal documents, confidential business data, or research materials.

Tools and Libraries Used

This project uses several Python libraries to implement cryptographic functions, file handling, and GUI interactions:

1. Cryptographic Libraries
Crypto.Cipher.AES (from PyCryptodome)
Implements AES-256 encryption and decryption in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode.
Ensures data confidentiality by preventing unauthorized access.
Crypto.Protocol.KDF.PBKDF2
Uses PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) to derive a strong encryption key from the user’s password.
Increases security by using a random salt and multiple iterations to prevent brute-force attacks.
hashlib
Helps in cryptographic operations, though not directly used for encryption in this script.
base64
Handles encoding and decoding operations if needed for encrypted data representation.
2. File and OS Handling Libraries
os
Generates secure random salt and IV (Initialization Vector).
Handles file path manipulations for reading and writing encrypted/decrypted files.
3. GUI and User Interaction
tkinter (built-in Python GUI library)
Provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for selecting files, entering passwords, and running encryption/decryption actions.
Uses:
Buttons for selecting files and performing actions.
Entry fields for password input.
Message boxes for success/error notifications.
Labels to display status messages.
Editor Platforms for Development

This script can be developed and executed in multiple Python-compatible platforms, including:

VS Code (Visual Studio Code)
Ideal for Python development with syntax highlighting, debugging, and terminal support.
Supports virtual environments and pip package management.
PyCharm
Provides code intelligence, debugging tools, and an interactive terminal.
Best for structured Python development.
Jupyter Notebook
Useful for testing encryption and decryption functions separately.
Limited for GUI-based applications.
Linux Terminal / Windows Command Prompt (cmd) / PowerShell
The script can be run as a standalone program via terminal commands.
Tkinter Environment (Python Built-in GUI)
Supports direct execution without additional installations.
Cross-platform, runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Applications and Use Cases

This AES-256 file encryption tool is applicable in various fields where data security is essential. Here are some key applications:

1. Secure File Storage
Encrypts sensitive documents, reports, financial records, or personal files.
Ensures data protection even if the storage device is compromised.
2. Data Transmission Security
Before sharing files via email, cloud storage, or USB, they can be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
Ensures that even if intercepted, the data remains unreadable without the correct password.
3. Corporate and Legal Document Protection
Businesses can use this tool to protect confidential client data, contracts, and intellectual property.
Prevents unauthorized copying and sharing of critical information.
4. Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking
Can be integrated into penetration testing and security auditing to test file encryption strength.
Helps security researchers understand encryption vulnerabilities and key management.
5. Cloud Security
Protects files before uploading them to cloud storage platforms like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive.
Ensures encrypted data storage, making cloud breaches less impactful.
6. Personal Data Protection
Useful for individuals who want to keep personal records, diaries, or images encrypted.
Helps maintain privacy and security in case of device theft.
Security Features of the Script

This script incorporates multiple security measures to ensure strong encryption:

AES-256 Encryption
256-bit key size ensures high security against brute-force attacks.
AES is an industry-standard encryption used by governments and enterprises.
Password-Based Key Derivation (PBKDF2)
Uses 100,000 iterations to make brute-force attacks computationally expensive.
Generates a strong key from user input.
Random Salt Generation
16-byte salt ensures that the same password doesn’t always generate the same encryption key.
Protects against rainbow table attacks.
Initialization Vector (IV) for CBC Mode
Random IV for every encryption session ensures that the same plaintext encrypts differently each time.
Prevents pattern analysis attacks.
Padding Mechanism
Uses PKCS7 padding to ensure proper encryption even when file sizes don't align with AES block size.
